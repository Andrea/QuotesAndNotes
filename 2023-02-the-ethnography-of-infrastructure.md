## Definition of Infrastructure



## One persons infrastructure is another’s topic

> "For the person in a wheelchair, the stairs and doorjamb in front of a building are not seamless subtenders of use, but barriers (Star,1991). One persons infrastructure is another’s topic, or difficulty. As Star and Ruhleder (1996) put it, infrastructure is a fundamentally relational concept, becoming real infrastructure in relation to organized practices (see also Jewett & Kling, 1991). "
